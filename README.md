# Random-Game-Picker
This java application opens a random game that you've added to the library of file directories. This is a useful and fun program to mess around with if you're ever bored and want to play a game, but don't know what to play first. I've sometimes had problems picking a game to play in my huge steam library, and there's some games I haven't even started. This program makes it so easy to pick a game since I won't be in a constant dilemma of which game to play since the program picks it for me.

# How to use the program
Using this program is pretty simple. All you have to do is download the .jar file nad double click on it to open. Add as many file directories to games as you want, and then click "open a random game" and it will randomly select one of the files and open it. An easy way to get a file directory is to right click a desktop icon and go to the security tab(next to "Object name:"), or shortcut tab if there is one. However, be wary that once you close the window, all of the games you added will be deleted and you'll have to add them again when you reopen the program. This is an issue that I'm trying fix, and suggestions are entirely welcome. If you want to edit the code and/or test it in an IDE, download the .java file.
